# Grafana distribution of OpenTelemetry .NET instrumentation

## About

This is a pre-configured and pre-packaged bundle of OpenTelemetry .NET
components, optimized for the Grafana Stack.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install package

For installing the distribution with the full set of dependencies, add a
reference to the [`Grafana.OpenTelemetry`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grafana.OpenTelemetry)
package to your project.

```sh
dotnet add package --prerelease Grafana.OpenTelemetry
```

### Step 2: Enable the Grafana distribution at application startup

The `UseGrafana` extension method on the `TracerProviderBuilder` or the
`MetricProviderBuilder` can be used to set up the Grafana distribution. By
default, telemetry data will be sent to a Grafana agent or an OTel collector
that runs locally and listens to default OTLP ports:

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;
using Grafana.OpenTelemetry;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        using var tracerProvider = Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
            .UseGrafana()
            .Build();
    }
}
```

* [Configuration](./docs/configuration.md)
* [Supported instrumentations](./docs/supported-instrumentations.md)

## Troubleshooting

This project utilizes the [self-diagnostics feature of the .NET OpenTelemetry SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry/README.md#self-diagnostics).

To enable self-diagnostics, go to the
[current working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory) of
your process and create a configuration file named `OTEL_DIAGNOSTICS.json` with
the following content:

```json
{
    "LogDirectory": ".",
    "FileSize": 32768,
    "LogLevel": "Warning"
}
```

To disable self-diagnostics, delete the above file.
